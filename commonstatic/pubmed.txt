Clinicians use forward bending and backward return in routine clinical examinations for evaluating spine mobility. The magnitude and timing of lumbar spine and pelvic contributions have been described in the literature as lumbopelvic rhythm. There is still limited knowledge about the factors which can determinate lumbar and hip mobility and coordination in the sagittal plane. The aim of this study is to demonstrate those factors contributing to the lumbopelvic rhythm and to explain the differences observed between subjects. The studies included in the review present possible explanations of observed lumbar-pelvic motion and/or coordination. They measure movement of the lumbar spine, the pelvis and/or the hip in the sagittal plane. The search was conducted in August 2017. Two databases (PubMed and Web of Science) were searched. The search identified 126 potentially relevant articles (53 in PubMed, 73 in Web of Science). Initial screening based on titles and abstracts retrieved 35 articles. The second stage of selection involved reading the full texts of articles. Twenty-four papers were selected in this stage. After careful bibliographic study, seven papers were added for this review, resulting in a total of 31. This literature review demonstrates those factors contributing to lumbopelvic motion. Age and gender, hamstring muscle tightness, feet position, muscle fatigue, movement speed and external loading as well phase of motion can affect various aspects of lumbopelvic rhythm.

'Filth flies' feed and develop in excrement and decaying matter and can transmit enteric pathogens to humans and animals, leading to colonization and infection. Considering these characteristics, 'filth flies' are potential vectors for the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). This review defines the role of flies in the spread of AMR and identifies knowledge gaps.
, 
The literature search (original articles, reviews indexed for PubMed) was restricted to the English language. References of identified studies were screened for additional sources.
, 
'Filth flies' are colonized with antimicrobial-resistant bacteria of clinical relevance. This includes extended spectrum beta-lactamase-, carbapenemase-producing and colistin-resistant (mcr-1 positive) bacteria. Resistant bacteria in flies often share the same genotypes with bacteria from humans and animals when their habitat overlap. The risk of transmission is most likely highest for enteric bacteria as they are shed in high concentration in excrements and are easily picked up by flies. 'Filth flies' can 'bio-enhance' the transmission of AMR as bacteria multiply in the digestive tract, mouthparts and regurgitation spots.
, 
To better understand the medical importance of AMR in flies, quantitative risk assessment models should be refined and fed with additional data (e.g. vectorial capacity, colonization dose). This requires targeted ecological, epidemiological and in vivo experimental studies.

This study aimed to quantitatively assess and compare the effect and safety of posterior fossa decompression with duraplasty (PFDD) and posterior fossa decompression (PFD) in treating patients with Chiari malformation type I (CM1). PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched through May 2017. Fourteen cohort studies, involving a total of 3666 patients with CM1, were included. Studies were pooled, and the relative risk (RR) and its corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. The decrease in syringomyelia was better for patients in the PFDD group than for patients in the PFD group (RR=1.57, 95%CI=1.07-2.32, P<sub>heterogeneity</sub>=0.042, I<sup>2</sup>=56.6%). The incidence of cerebrospinal fluid leak (RR=5.23, 95%CI=2.61-10.51, P<sub>heterogeneity</sub>=0.830, I<sup>2</sup>=0%) and aseptic meningitis (RR=4.02, 95%CI=1.46-11.03, P<sub>heterogeneity</sub>=0.960, I<sup>2</sup>=0%) significantly increased among patients in the PFDD group compared with those in the PFD group. On stratifying by age, a significantly reduced risk in the reoperation rate was observed in the adult group. However, the clinical improvement and the incidence of wound infection were not significantly different between the two groups. This study confirmed that the decrease in syringomyelia was better for patients treated with PFDD than for those treated with PFD alone. However, no significant difference was found in the clinical improvement and the reoperation rate between the two groups.

Two tumor foci are the most common in multifocal papillary thyroid carcinoma, but whether they should be regarded as the indicator of central lymph node metastasis remains unclear. To investigate the role of two tumor foci for predicting central lymph node metastasis, we performed a meta-analysis of published studies.
, 
We performed a systematic literature search of PubMed, Embase and Web of Science prior to September 29, 2017. The relevant articles were examined and the eligible studies were included to assess the metastatic risk of central lymph node in papillary thyroid carcinoma with one, two and more than two (&gt;2) tumor foci.
, 
Five eligible studies included 4045 patients in this meta-analysis. Two tumor foci were the most common in multifocal papillary thyroid carcinoma (63.8%, 939/1471). Multifocality group showed a higher risk of central lymph node metastasis compared with unifocality group (odds ratio: 1.58, 95% confidence interval: 1.37-1.81). The risk of central lymph node metastasis was higher in two tumor foci group than unifocality group (odds ratio: 1.38, 95% confidence interval: 1.17-1.62). However, this risk in two tumor foci group was lower than &gt;2 tumor foci group (odds ratio: 0.62, 95% confidence interval: 0.42-0.92). Begg's test revealed no obvious publication bias.
, 
This meta-analysis suggested that two tumor foci should be regarded as the predictive factor of central lymph node metastasis, but the role of it was less important than three or more than three tumor foci. Understanding the role of two tumor foci for predicting CLNM may help clinicians make an optimal decision of treatment and the extent of surgery for multifocal papillary thyroid carcinoma.

Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is gradually emerging as the treatment of choice for end-stage osteoarthritis. In the past, Perioperative dexamethasone treatment is still a controversial subject in total knee arthroplasty. Therefore, we write this systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of dexamethasone on pain and recovery after Total knee Arthroplasty.
, 
Embase, Pubmed, and Cochrane Library were comprehensively searched. Randomized controlled trials, cohort studies were included in our meta-analysis. Eight studies that compared dexamethasone groups with placebo groups were included in our meta-analysis. The research was reported according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Randomized controlled trials were included in our meta-analysis.
, 
Our study demonstrated that the dexamethasone group was more effective than the placebo group in term of VAS score at 24 h(P &lt; 0.00001), 48 h(P = 0.0002); Opioid consumption (P &lt; 0.00001); postoperative nausea (P &lt; 0.00001); and Inflammatory factors of CPR at 24 h (P = 0.003).
, 
Our meta-analysis demonstrated that dexamethasone decreased postoperative pain, the incidence of POVN, and total opioid consumption effectively which played a critical role in rapid recovery to TKA. However, we still need large sample size, high quality studies to explore the relationship between complications and dose response to give the final conclusion.

Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in patients on dialysis. Although vitamin D deficiency is closely associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and high mortality in the general population, the relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in dialysis patients is uncertain. We aim to explore the relationship between serum 25(OH)D levels and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in dialysis patients.
, 
This is a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical studies among patients receiving maintenance dialysis. We did a systematic literature search in PubMed and Embase to identify studies reporting the relationship between serum 25(OH)D levels and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients on dialysis. The search was last updated on 10 February 2017.
, 
The study included 18 moderate to high-quality cohort studies with an overall sample of 14 154 patients on dialysis. The relative risk of all-cause mortality per 10 ng/mL increase in serum 25(OH)D level was 0.78 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71-0.86], although there was marked heterogeneity (I2=96%, P &lt; 0.01) that was partly explained by differences in CVD prevalence, baseline parathyroid hormone level and dialysis duration among included studies. The relative risk of cardiovascular mortality per 10 ng/mL increase in serum 25(OH)D level was 0.71 (95% CI 0.63-0.79), with substantial heterogeneity (I2=74%, P=0.004) that was largely explained by differences in study type and serum 25(OH)D measurement method.
, 
In the present study, increased serum 25(OH)D level was significantly associated with lower all-cause mortality and lower cardiovascular mortality in dialysis patients.

The aim of this study was to determine how many papers have been retracted or withdrawn, and for what reason, in journals relating to plastic surgery.PubMed and SCOPUS were used, with the search terms (retracted OR withdrawn) AND (article OR publication OR paper) AND {(plastic surgery) OR (cosmetic surgery) OR (maxillofacial surgery) OR (craniofacial surgery)}. The papers were analyzed and classified according to the reason for retraction or withdrawal, journal name, publication year, and author. In the PubMed and SCOPUS, 227 and 114 titles were found, respectively, from which 34 duplicate titles were removed. An additional 261 titles which did not include "retracted" or "withdrawn" were removed, leaving 46 papers and 6 mined papers were added. The 52 full texts (42 "retracted" and 10 "withdrawn") were analyzed.The most frequent reason for retraction or withdrawal was duplication (17, 32.7%) followed by the author's request (9, 17.3%), plagiarism (7, 13.5%), and lack of permission (5, 9.6%). Retraction was most common in Plast Reconstr Surg (6, 12%) followed by Aesthetic Plast Surg (4, 7.9%), Ann Plast Surg (2, 3.9%), J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg (2, 3.9%), and Surg Res (2, 3.9%). Most authors retracted a paper just once; however, 6 authors retracted a paper twice or more. The first retraction was found in 1991, and the number of retractions showed a tendency to increase over time. However, the duplication rate did not change over time (R = 0.178, P = 0.117).Journal reviewers, as well as production editors, should check for duplication, plagiarism, or permission-related problems.

In 2006, Villa et al. published a review article concerning the use of thread-lift sutures and concluded that the technique was still in its infancy but had great potential to become a useful and effective procedure for nonsurgical lifting of sagged facial tissues. As 11 years have passed, the authors now performed again a systematic review to determine the real scientific current state of the art on the use of thread-lift sutures.
, 
A systematic review was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines using the PubMed database and using the Medical Subject Headings search term "Rhytidoplasty." "Rhytidoplasty" and the following entry terms were included by this Medical Subject Headings term: "facelift," "facelifts," "face Lift," "Face Lifts," "Lift," "Face," "Lifts," "Platysmotomy," "Platysmotomies," "Rhytidectomy," "Rhytidectomies," "Platysmaplasty," "and "Platysmaplasties." The Medical Subject Headings term "Rhytidoplasty" was combined with the following search terms: "Barbed suture," "Thread lift," "APTOS," "Suture suspension," "Percutaneous," and "Silhouette suture." RefWorks was used to filter duplicates. Three of the authors (H.A.G., B.C., and B.L.) performed the search independently.
, 
The initial search with all search terms resulted in 188 articles. After filtering the duplicates and the articles about open procedures, a total of 41 articles remained. Of these, the review articles, case reports, and letters to the editor were subsequently excluded, as were reports dealing with nonbarbed sutures, such as Vicryl and Prolene with Gore-Tex. This resulted in a total of 12 articles, seven additional articles since the five articles reviewed by Villa et al.
, 
The authors' review demonstrated that, within the past decade, little or no substantial evidence has been added to the peer-reviewed literature to support or sustain the promising statement about thread-lift sutures as made by Villa et al. in 2006 in terms of efficacy or safety. All included literature in the authors' review, except two studies, demonstrated at best a very limited durability of the lifting effect. The two positive studies were sponsored by the companies that manufacture the thread-lift sutures.

An untoward outcome following breast reconstruction is diminished or complete loss of sensation. As the reconstructive paradigm continues to evolve, sensory restoration following reconstruction remains a research focus. Despite the multitude of published outcomes, there is marked heterogeneity across studies, thus confounding published outcomes. This study critically appraises the literature to summarize outcomes and establish a framework to guide clinical practice and future research.
, 
A literature review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines in an effort to perform a meta-analysis. The Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, and ClinicalTrials.gov online databases were queried to capture all publications between 1990 and 2017 that investigated postreconstruction breast sensation. The primary outcome of interest was breast sensation following both implant-based and autologous reconstruction with or without neurotization. Secondary outcomes of interest included time to sensory testing and patient-reported outcomes.
, 
Overall, 503 titles were screened, from which 37 articles were ultimately included for analysis, accounting for 1299 patients. There was major methodologic variability and inconsistent measurable outcomes across studies. It can be deduced that postoperative sensation returns spontaneously and unpredictably, neurotization enhances the magnitude and rapidity of sensory restoration when compared to nonneurotized reconstruction, and a sensate reconstruction improves patient-reported outcomes.
, 
Significant study design discrepancies exist, making it difficult to combine data and assess results. To effectively study breast sensation and the impact of neurotization, future investigation will depend on standardizing the way in which breast sensation is measured.

A Systematic Review.']['Journal Article']['Clinical orthopaedics and related research'][
Psychosocial factors are key determinants of health and can influence patient-reported outcomes after rotator cuff tears. However, to our knowledge, a systematic review of published studies has not been conducted to determine the degree of consistency and strength of the relationship between psychosocial factors and patient-reported outcomes in this patient population.
, 
(1) Are psychosocial factors associated with patient-reported measures at initial clinical presentation in patients with rotator cuff tears? (2) Are psychosocial factors associated with patient-reported outcomes after treatment in patients with rotator cuff tears?
, 
A systematic review of cross-sectional and prospective observational studies was performed in MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Web of Science from each database's inception to June 2016. We included studies examining associations between psychosocial factors and patient-reported measures in patients with rotator cuff tears. We excluded studies not reporting on this relationship, involving patients with nonspecific shoulder pain, and written in a language other than English. Two independent reviewers performed the search, extracted information, and assessed methodological quality. Study quality was assessed using the Methodological Items for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) criteria. The primary outcomes for the review were associations between each psychosocial factor and patient-reported measures of function or disability, pain, or quality of life. Associations were interpreted based on significance, strength, and direction of the relationship. A total of 10 studies (five cross-sectional and five prospective) in 1410 patients (age range, 46-62 years, 60% [571 of 958] men) were included in the review. Pooling of results for meta-analyses was not possible as a result of study heterogeneity.
, 
Weak to moderate cross-sectional associations were found for emotional or mental health with function or disability and pain in multiple studies. Lower emotional or mental health function was associated with greater pain or disability or lower physical function at initial evaluation. Only one psychosocial factor (patient expectation) was weak to moderately associated with patient-reported outcomes after treatment in more than one study. In the two studies that examined expectations, the higher the expectation of benefit, the greater the perceived benefit after surgical intervention.
, 
At the initial evaluation of patients with rotator cuff tear, there was an association between self-reported function and pain and emotional or mental health. However, these factors were not associated with patient-reported outcomes after intervention. This finding could be attributed to the lack of large prospective studies in this area or complex phenotypes within this patient population. Preoperative patient expectation is an important predictor of patient-reported outcomes in patients after rotator cuff surgery and may be a modifiable target for enhancing recovery.
