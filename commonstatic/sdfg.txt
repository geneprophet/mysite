The syndrome of delayed fetal growth (SDFG) is one of the most wide-spread pathological conditions while course of pregnancy; it is characterized by disorder of the feto-placental system function. Its incidence is from 3 to 8%. The studying of peculiarities of the system and local immune disorders, coinciding with SDFG, would permit to establish the immune mechanisms of its formation.
