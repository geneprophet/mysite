Assess geographic variation in breast cancer racial mortality disparity by age cohorts in US and ten cities with large African American populations.
, 
Non-Hispanic Black (NHB) and Non-Hispanic White (NHW) female breast cancer mortality rates and NHB:NHW rate ratio (RR) (disparity) were calculated by four age group categories: &lt;40, 40-49, 50-64 and 65+ with time period 1999-2013.
, 
In all 10 cities and the US, the most pronounced breast cancer disparities, measured by RR, were seen among younger women. In age group &lt;40, the RR ranges from 1.71 in Houston to 5.37 in Washington, DC. For age group 50-64, the disparity was less pronounced, ranging from 1.24 in New York to 1.72 in Chicago. For 65+ age group, there was wide city to city variation in breast cancer mortality disparity. Three cities had higher mortality for NHW compared to NHB; Baltimore 0.78, Washington DC 0.94 and New York 0.98. One city had no statistically significant racial variation in breast cancer mortality in this age group and six cities had increased NHB: NHW mortality disparities.
, 
While the mortality rate for breast cancer is lower among younger women, the NHB:NHW disparities, as measured by rate ratios, are most pronounced in these age groups. Given the absence of available data regarding incidence, stage and subtypes, further research is necessary and such research is important, given the possible policy implications of these results with respect to screening guidelines and coverage for mammography and breast cancer treatment in particular for younger NHB women.

It has long been a puzzle in cancer treatment that despite the initial appearance of apoptosis, the process could be reversed in some cancer cells and often results in more aggressive tumors and metastasis. The mechanism for this recurrence is yet unknown. Here we report that human mammary carcinoma cells induced to undergo apoptosis could recover with increased tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo, and induced lymph node metastasis. Specifically, the reversed cells underwent epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions in the primary tumors in situ, and mesenchymal-to-epithelial transitions in the metastatic cells. Flow cytometry confirmed an elevated percentage of cells carrying cancer stem cells (CSCs) markers (CD44<sup>+</sup>/CD24<sup>-</sup>) in the reversed breast cancer cell population, with hypomethylated CD44 promoters and hypermethylated CD24 promoters. More importantly, CSCs were generated anew from non-stem cancer cells after apoptosis reversal possibly through epigenetic modifications. The results from this study can open doors to discovering more effective cancer treatments by suppressing apoptosis reversal.

Phyto-synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) was achieved using aqueous garlic, green tea and turmeric extracts, and characterized by different spectroscopic techniques. Phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of rich amount of biochemicals in these extracts, which serve as reducing and capping agents for converting silver nitrate into AgNPs. FT IR spectroscopy confirmed the role of biomolecules in the bioreduction and efficient stabilization of AgNPs. UV-Vis DRS spectra showed a band around 450 nm characteristics of AgNPs. XRD patterns revealed the crystalline nature of the synthesized AgNPs with fcc structure. SEM and TEM analysis revealed the spherical shape of the synthesized AgNPs with an average particle size of 8 nm. EDX analysis confirmed the purity of the synthesized AgNPs with a strong signal at 3.2 keV. The antioxidant activity was assessed by ABTS, DPPH, p-NDA, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and DMSO scavenging assays, in which the AgNPs synthesized using green method showed remarkable activity with respect to the standard antioxidants ascorbic acid and rutin. In vitro cytotoxicity activity was tested on four cancer cell lines such as human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), cervical (HeLa), epithelioma (Hep-2) and lung (A549) along with one normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) cell line. The AgNPs synthesized using turmeric extract exhibits excellent antioxidant and cytotoxicity activity compared to that synthesized using other extracts.

The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is rarely affected by secondary tumors. Patients often present at advanced stage, and prognosis is dismal. This study aimed to analyze clinical, endoscopic and pathological features of secondary tumors that had been diagnosed endoscopically.
, 
We conducted a retrospective database analysis of 217 patients with secondary tumors of the GIT. Endoscopic findings and histological diagnoses were systematically re-evaluated.
, 
Malignant melanoma (n= 33, 15%), breast (n= 32, 15%) and pancreatic cancer (n=27, 12%) were the most common corresponding primaries. About one-third of secondary tumors was detected in the stomach (n=76, 35%), followed by small intestine (n=54, 25%) and rectum (n=53, 24%). Median time between diagnosis of primary and secondary tumors was 19 months (mean, 31, range 0-251) and this was particularly long for renal cell carcinoma and breast cancer (median 38 and 45 months, respectively). Direct invasion from extragastrointestinal malignancies was more common (56%) than vascular cancer spread (44%) and depended on both site of tumor involvement and corresponding primary. Lesions presented with various endoscopic patterns. In patients for whom a definitive diagnosis of cancer was known before the examination (n=168), a secondary tumor was included in differential diagnosis in only 48% of lesions. It is of note that the remaining cases were diagnosed endoscopically as primary tumor and rarely also as non-neoplastic change.
, 
Secondary tumors may affect all parts of the GIT. Malignant melanoma and breast and pancreatic cancer represent the most common primaries. Biopsy diagnosis is crucial to avoid misclassification.

Esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs) have a poor prognosis mostly due to early metastasis. To explore the early event of metastasis in ESCC, we established an in vitro selection model to mimic the interaction of tumor cells with extracellular matrix, through which a sub-line of ESCC cells with high invasive ability was generated. By comparing the gene expression profile of the highly invasive sub-line to that of the parental cells, ADAM12-L was identified as a candidate gene promoting ESCC cell invasion. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the ADAM12-L was overexpressed in human ESCC tissues, especially at cancer invasive edge, and ADAM12-L overexpression tightly correlated with increased metastasis and poor outcome of ESCC patients. Indeed, ADAM12-L knockdown reduced the invasion and metastasis of ESCC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ADAM12-L participated in focal adhesion turnover and promoted the activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which in turn increased ADAM12-L transcription through FAK/JNK/c-Jun axis. Therefore, a loop initiated from the cancer cell upon the engagement with extracellular matrix through FAK and c-Jun to enhance ADAM12-L expression is established, leading to the positive feedback of further FAK activation and prompting metastasis. Our study indicates that overexpression of ADAM12-L can serve as a precision marker to determine the activation of this loop. Targeting ADAM12-L to disrupt this positive feedback loop represents a promising strategy to treat the metastasis of esophageal cancers.

RDD648, a novel derivative of a natural molecule riccardin D, exhibited potent anticancer activity by targeting lysosomes in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic studies revealed that RDD648 facilitated STAT3 translocation into the nucleus, and this activity was involved in lysosome-mediated cell death as evidenced by our finding that inhibition of STAT3 alleviated lysosomal membrane permeabilization. Further investigation indicated that nuclear STAT3 directly interacted with transcription factor TFEB, leading to the partial loss of function of TFEB which is essential for lysosome turnover. The present study first uncovers that STAT3 contributes to lysosomal-mediated cell death in RDD648-treated breast cancer cells though interacting with TFEB, and the findings may be significant in the design of treatments for breast cancers where STAT3 is constitutively expressed.

Clinical applications'][
Secretory carcinoma (SC) of the breast is defined as an indolent tumor but is still categorized into a basal-like triple-negative breast cancer (BL-TNBC) subgroup that generally shows aggressive behaviour according to the current classification. Despite the unique clinical behaviour of SC, molecular characteristics that reflect biological behaviours of SC remain largely unknown.
, 
We employed a combinatorial approach of whole-exome sequencing and mass spectrometry-based in-depth quantitative proteomics to determine the entire molecular landscape of SC using three SC formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues.
, 
Exome sequencing and proteomic analysis of SC identified 419 unique somatic mutations and 721 differentially expressed proteins as compared with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), respectively. Several pathways related to cancer metabolism were significantly upregulated in the SC group. Comparative analyses with multiple datasets revealed that SC shares genomic mutations and biological pathways more closely related to hormone receptor-positive breast cancer than BL-TNBC.
, 
Our multi-omic analyses provide evidence that SC harbours substantially different molecular genomic and proteomic landscapes compared with BL-TNBC. These results provide an entire spectrum of in-depth molecular landscapes to support the hypothesis that SC is distinct from BL-TNBC. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

True invasive tubular breast carcinoma (TBC) is unlikely to metastasize to axillary nodes, yet it is routinely subjected to sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), even if the diagnosis was suspected preoperatively. The positive predictive value (PPV) of core biopsy for TBC and the incidence and predictors of axillary metastasis in invasive breast carcinomas identified as tubular-rich on core biopsy are unknown. Prospective patient and tumor data regarding postoperatively confirmed TBCs, and tubular-rich carcinoma identified on preoperative core biopsy between January 2005 and May 2016 was analyzed retrospectively. Axillary metastasis occurred in only 4.2% (4/95) of TBCs, all of which measured &gt;15 mm pathologically. In 11.1% (11/99) of TBCs, the initial core biopsy was either indeterminate/suspicious or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS); therefore, their true tubular histotype and size were ascertained following operative excision and before SLNB. Nine were ≤15 mm, and all were node-negative. Only 63.9% (46/72) of tubular-rich core biopsies were confirmed as TBCs; the remaining 36.1% (26/72) were well-differentiated invasive nontubular carcinomas. None of the preoperative patient or tumor features were predictive of true TBC on multivariable analysis; 10.1% (7/69) of carcinomas identified as tubular-rich on core biopsy (regardless of their true histotypes) were node-positive; 23.1% (6/26) in nontubular and 2.3% (1/43) in true tubular carcinomas. Preoperative ultrasound size &gt;15 mm was associated with axillary metastasis in 40.0% (4/10) compared to 5.7% (3/53) in those ≤15 mm (OR = 11.11, 95% CI = 1.99-62.04; multivariable P = .010). Axillary metastasis in TBC is dependent on pathological size; therefore, a case is made for omitting SLNB in small true TBCs confirmed following excision. Preoperative tubular-rich core biopsy is not adequately diagnostic of TBC; however, it selects carcinomas that are well-differentiated, small, and unlikely to metastasize to the axilla, thus allowing for the selective omission of SLNB.

Young women with unilateral breast cancer are increasingly choosing contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM), despite its limited medical benefit for most women. The purpose of this study was to better understand this choice through a qualitative exploration of surgical decision-making in young survivors, including how issues particular to younger women affected their decision and the post-surgical experience.
, 
Women age ≤40 years with stage 0-III breast cancer, 1-3 years from diagnosis who had undergone breast cancer surgery were recruited to participate. Four focus groups were conducted: two with women who had bilateral mastectomy and two with women who kept their contralateral breast. Focus groups were recorded and transcribed with identifiers removed. Emergent themes were identified by thematic content analysis using NVivo 11.
, 
Of the twenty participants, median age at diagnosis was 37 years. Emergent themes were categorized into the following domains: 1) emotions/feelings surrounding surgery/decision about surgery; 2) factors affecting the decision; 3) communication and interaction with the healthcare team; 4) impact on post-surgical life and recovery; 5) support needs. Young women who chose CPM often were concerned about a future breast event, despite this low risk, suggesting some gain peace of mind by choosing CPM. Young survivors also had many physical and emotional concerns after surgery for which they did not always feel prepared.
, 
Informational resources and decision aids may enhance patient-doctor communication and help young survivors better understand risk and manage expectations surrounding short and longer-term physical and emotional effects after surgery.

Clinical management of microinvasive breast cancer (Tmic) remains controversial. Although metastases are infrequent in Tmic carcinoma patients, surgical treatment typically includes lymph node sampling. The objective of this study was to determine the rate and predictors of lymph node metastases, recurrence, and survival in a large series of Tmic breast carcinomas. Consecutive cases of Tmic were identified within our health care system from 2001 to 2015. We reviewed results of lymph node sampling and other pathologic factors including hormone receptor/HER2 status, associated in situ tumor size/grade, margin status, number of invasive foci, surgical/adjuvant therapies, and recurrence/survival outcomes. In this cohort, 294 Tmic cases were identified with mean follow-up of 4.6 years. Of 260 patients who underwent axillary staging, lymph node metastases were identified in 1.5% (all of which were ductal type). All Tmic cases with positive lymph node metastases had associated DCIS with size &gt; 5 cm (5.3-8.5 cm) compared to a median DCIS tumor size of 2.5 cm (0.2-19.0 cm) for the entire cohort. No lymph node metastases were seen with microinvasive lobular carcinoma. During the follow-up period, there were no regional/distant recurrences or breast cancer-associated deaths in a mean follow-up period of 4.6 years. Two patients developed subsequent ipsilateral breast cancer (DCIS) in a different quadrant than the original Tmic. Clinical behavior of microinvasive breast cancer in this series is similar to DCIS. Lymph node metastases are uncommon and were only seen with ductal type microinvasive carcinoma. Our data suggest limited benefit for routine node sampling and support management of Tmic similar to DCIS, particularly for patients with DCIS &lt; 5 cm in size.
